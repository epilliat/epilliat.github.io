I am an assistant professor in statistics at ENSAI (Rennes) working on topics related to machine learning and high-dimensional statistics. My PhD centered on two areas in modern statistics: change-point detection and ranking problems. 

I am interested in GPU parallel computing. I'm currently developing a Julia library focused on optimizing fundamental functions like `mapreduce` (for operations such as sum) and `accumulate` (for operations like prefix sum). You can explore my experimental work at my GitHub repository [Luma](https://github.com/epilliat/Luma) for more technical details.
