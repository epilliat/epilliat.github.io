## Symetric Random Variable

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
- A median of $X$ is a $0.5$-quantile of its distribution
- If $X$ has density $p$, the median $m$ is such that
$$
\int_{-\infty}^m p(x)dx = \int_{m}^{+\infty} p(x)dx =  0.5 \; .
$$
- A **symmetric** random variable $X$ is such that the distribution of $X$ is the same as the distribution of $-X$.
- In particular, its median is $0$.
- If $X$ is a **symmetric** random variable, then it has the same distribution as $\varepsilon |X|$ where $\varepsilon$ is independent of $X$ and uniformly distributed in $\{-1,1\}$

## Symetrization
- If $X$ and $Y$ are two **independent** variables with same density $p$, then $X-Y$ is symetric.
- Indeed:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb P(X - Y \leq t) &=\int_{-\infty}^t \mathbb P(X \leq t+y)p(y)dy \\
&=\int_{-\infty}^t \mathbb P(Y \leq t+x)p(x)dy = \mathbb P(Y-X \leq t) \; .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Dependency Problem for Paired Data

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
- We observe iid pairs of real numbers $(X_1, Y_1), \dots, (X_n, Y_n)$. The density of each pair $(X_i, Y_i)$  is **unknown** $p_{XY}(x,y)$.

- The marginal distribution of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are, respectively,
$$p_X(x) = \int_{y \in \mathbb R} p_{XY}(x,y)~~~~ \text{ and }~~~~ p_{Y}(y) = \int_{x \in \mathbb R} p_{XY}(x,y) \; .$$
- $H_0:$ The distribution of $(X_i - Y_i)$ is symetric
- $H_1:$ The distribution of  $(X_i - Y_i)$ is not symetric
:::

:::{.callout-warning .fragment}
- The pairs are assume to be independent, but within each pair, $Y_i$ **can depend on** $X_i$ (that is, we don't necessarily have $p(x,y) =p_X(x)p_Y(y)$).
- If $X_i$ is independent of $Y_i$ for all $i$, then we are under $H_0$.

## Wilcoxon's Signed Rank Test


:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
- $D_i = X_i - Y_i$
- We define the **sign** of pair $i$ as the sign of $D_i=X_i - Y_i$. It is in $\{-1, 1\}$.
- We define the **rank** of pair $i$ as the permutation $R_i$ that satisfies $|D_{R_i}| = |D_{(i)}|$, where
$$
|D_{(1)}| \leq  \dots \leq |D_{(n)}| 
$$

## Properties on the Signed Ranks 
Under $H_0$, 

- Signs of the $(D_i)$'s are independent and **uniformly distributed** in $\{-1, 1\}$. 
- In particular, the number of signs equal to $+1$ follows a Binomial distribution $\mathcal B(n,0.5)$.
- The ranks $R_i$ of the $(|D_i|)$'s does not depend on the **unknown** density $p_{X-Y}$. $(R_1, \dots, R_n)$ is a **random permutation** under $H_0$.
  
- Hence, any deterministic function of the ranks and of the differences is a **pivotal test statistic**: it does not depend on the distribution of the data under $H_0$.

- Wilcoxon's test statistic:
$W_- = \sum_{i=1}^n R_i \mathbf 1\{D_i < 0\}$
- Sometimes, also $W_+ = \sum_{i=1}^n R_i \mathbf 1\{D_i < 0\}$ or $\min(W_-, W_+)$.
- Gaussian approximation: $W_- \asymp n(n+1)/4 + \sqrt{n(n+1)(2n+1)/24} \mathcal N(0,1)$
