## Exercise 1

We aim to determine whether ENSAI students have any preference for cats or dogs. We assume that, a priori, they have no preference on average. We ask $n$ students what their preferences are, and we let $X$ be the number of "cat" answers.

1. Define $H_0$ and $H_1$. Is it a one-sided (unilatéral) or two-sided (bilatéral) test ?
3. We observe $10$ students and $X=8$ "cat" answers. Compute the pvalue in this specific case. Interprete the result.
4. Write the expression of the pvalue in terms of $n$ and $X$ and $F$, the cdf of $\mathrm{Bin}(n,0.5)$.
5. Write a line of code to compute the pvalue in Julia, Python or R.
6. What is the pvalue if $H_1$ is instead
    a. "Students prefer cats" or
    b. "Students prefer dogs"


## Exercise 2

Let $(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$ be iid random variables that follow distribution $\mathcal E(\lambda)$. We want to test:
$$
H_0: \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \lambda = 1.
$$

1. Show that if $X \sim E(\lambda)$ and $Y \sim \Gamma(k, \lambda)$ are independent, with $k \in \mathbb{N}^*$, then $X + Y \sim \Gamma(k+1, \lambda)$. *We recall that the density of $\Gamma(\lambda, k)$ is given by $p(x) = \frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1}e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}$*

2. Deduce that $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ follows a Gamma distribution $\Gamma(n, \lambda)$.

3. For a sample of size $n = 10$, What is the rejection region of $S_n$ at the $0.05$ significance level for the simple likelihood ratio test?\
*We admit that a Gamma distribution $\Gamma(n, \frac{1}{2})$ is a chi-squared distribution with $2n$ degrees of freedom, $\chi^2(2n)$.* **Bonus**: Show this fact for $n=1$, using a polar change of variable.

1.  The empirical mean is $\bar{x}_{10} = 2.5$. What can we conclude?
2.  Recall what a cdf is, and read the p-value on the cdf of the $\chi^2(20)$ distribution
![](cdfs/chi20.svg)

1. Compare the p-value if we use a Gaussian approximation of $\sum X_i$ with the TCL. We recall that $\mathbb V(X_1) = \frac{1}{\lambda}$.


## Exercise 3

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be random variables drawn from a normal distribution $N(\theta, 1)$. To test $H_0: \theta = 5$ against $H_1: \theta > 5$, we propose the following test:

$$
T = \mathbf 1\{\bar{x} > 5 + u \},
$$

where $\bar{x}$ is the empirical mean and $u$ is to be fixed.

1. 
   a. Derive the function $t \to \mathbb P(Z \geq t) - e^{-t^2/2}$, where $Z \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$
   b. Deduce that $\mathbb P(Z \geq t) \leq e^{-t^2/2}$ for all $t$
2. Deduce a value of $u$ such that the type I error of this test is smaller than a given $\alpha$. Rewrite the test $T$ in function of $\alpha$.

3. Fix $\alpha = 1/e$ (and $u= \sqrt{2/n}$). Compute the power function.

## Exercise 4

Let the family of Pareto distributions with **known** parameter $a$ and **unknown** parameter $\theta$:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{\theta}{a} \left( \frac{a}{x} \right)^{\theta+1}, & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
0, & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
$$

1. Compute the mean and variance of $X$, if $X$ follows a Pareto distribution of parameter $a$ and $\theta$.
2. Rewrite the density in the form $f(x) = a(x)b(\theta)e^{c(\theta)d(x)}$ and identify $a$,$b$,$c$ and $d$.
3. Deduce the general form of the uniformly most powerful test $UMP_\alpha$ for $H_0: \theta \geq \theta_0$ vs. $H_1: \theta < \theta_0$.
4. For $a = 1$, construct the test for the null hypothesis: the mean of the distribution is smaller than or equal to 2. 
5. What is the density of $d(X_1)$ ? *$d$ is defined in Q.2*
6. Write a line of code in Julia, Python or R to compute the rejection region at level $\alpha=0.05$.
