## Exercise 1

We want to test if a die is biased. it is rolled $1000$ times, and the number of occurrences for each face is recorded. The data is as follows:

|          | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Counts| 159 | 168 | 167 | 160 | 175 | 171 |

1. Formulate the hypothesis testing problem
2. Compute the expected counts under $H_0$, give the degree of freedom $d$ of the chi-squared test statistic and give the approximated p-value, using the cdf of $\chi^2(d)$:

[//]: we get 0.95

## Exercise 2

In a survey of $825$ families with $3$ children, the number of boys was recorded:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Number of Boys} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & \text{Total} \\
\hline
\text{Number of Families} & 71 & 297 & 336 & 121 & 825 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

We assume under $H_0$ that the genders of children in successive births within a family are independent categorical variables and that the probability $p$ of having a boy remains constant.

1. Determine the distribution of the number of boys in a family with 3 children as a function of $p$.
2. Estimate $p$ using a maximum likelihood estimator.
3. Test the goodness of fit to the distribution obtained in question 1.


## Exercise 3
We observe
``X = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 1, 1, 1, 0.7, 0.9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0.1, 0, 1]``
We assume that the entries of $X$ are iid of distribution $P$.
We consider the following hypothesis testing problem:

$H_0$: $P= \mathcal B(0.5)$ (Bernoulli)$\quad$ VS $\quad$ $H_1$: $P \neq \mathcal B(0.5)$.

1. What can you say about the assumptions, $H_0$ and $H_1$?
2. Draw on the same graph the CDF of a Bernoulli $0.5$ and the empirical CDF of the observed data $X$.
3. Apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test at level $0.1$. To do so, use this [table](https://real-statistics.com/statistics-tables/kolmogorov-smirnov-table/).
4. Comment on the result.
