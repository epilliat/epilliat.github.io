## Exercise

A quality control analyst at a semiconductor manufacturing plant is tracking chip failures during production. For each production batch, the analyst records the number of chips that pass inspection before the batch is terminated (due to various production constraints, not a fixed number of failures). \
**Dataset**: Number of working chips produced in $150$ different production batches.

| Working Chips | Number of Batches | Percentage |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0             | 8                 | 5.3%       |
| 1             | 10                | 6.7%       |
| 2             | 16                | 10.7%      |
| 3             | 17                | 11.3%      |
| 4             | 21                | 14.0%      |
| 5             | 20                | 13.3%      |
| 6             | 17                | 11.3%      |
| 7             | 14                | 9.3%       |
| 8             | 10                | 6.7%       |
| 9             | 7                 | 4.7%       |
| 10            | 3                 | 2.0%       |
| 11            | 5                 | 3.3%       |
| 12            | 2                 | 1.3%       |
| **Total**     | **150**           | **100%**   |

1. What distribution do you suspect the number of working chips should follow?
2. Test the goodness of fit to this distribution.
